TeachTeam – React-based University Project

My teammate and I developed TeachTeam, a web application designed to streamline the process of lecturers hiring tutors or lab assistants for specific university courses.

How it works:

Lecturers can browse available courses listed in the system.

For each course, lecturers can view applications from candidates and evaluate their credentials.

Lecturers have the ability to hire candidates based on their preferences, course requirements, and qualifications.

Technology Stack:

Frontend: React (framework) with TypeScript for type safety and Chakra UI for responsive and modern styling.

Backend: TypeORM with Node.js to manage server-side operations.

Database: MySQL to store courses, tutor profiles, and hiring records.

Other tools: Node.js package ecosystem to handle dependencies and streamline development.

Key Learning Outcomes:

Built a full-stack web application integrating both frontend and backend technologies.

Gained hands-on experience with TypeScript and React for building scalable, maintainable UIs.

Designed relational database structures in MySQL and integrated them with TypeORM for backend logic.

Collaborated in a team environment, applying project planning and version control best practices.
